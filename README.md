# My-Portfolio
1. Description: 
This is my portfolio page! It has placeholder images and functional links to placeholder pages for future projects and functional links for my contact me section for a potiental future employer. I added a lot of my own flare to it.
2. My Role: 
I am the lead and sole designer and creator. I have made the page semantically correct and made sure that the functionality fits the acceptance criteria and user story.
